Gambatte Resources

This repository contains palettes and borders to be used in the OpenDingux version of Gambatte emulator.

To use them just copy both folders to your .gambatte folder in the home directory of your device.

Palette files will be made using the official colors in the bootstrap, as documented here https://tcrf.net/Notes:Game_Boy_Color_Bootstrap_ROM#Assigned_Palette_Configurations

Borders require some image editing skills, so just a few games will be included. Feel free to make pull request for both borders and palettes than are not in the repository yet.

# Creating new palettes

To create a new palette just create an empty .pal file and use a text editor to paste the BG, OBJ0 and OBJ1 color codes inside with a text editor.

As and example, a file containing

0x000000 0x000000 0x000000 0x000000  
0x000000 0x000000 0x000000 0x000000  
0x000000 0x000000 0x000000 0x000000  

would map every color as black and a file containing

0xFFFFFF 0xFFFFFF 0xFFFFFF 0xFFFFFF  
0xFFFFFF 0xFFFFFF 0xFFFFFF 0xFFFFFF  
0xFFFFFF 0xFFFFFF 0xFFFFFF 0xFFFFFF  

would map every color as white.

Name the .pal file the same way as the gb file and you are done.
